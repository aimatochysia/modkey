# Abstract
	Sometimes when using keybaord, its feel nicer to have 60% especially during trips or being mobile for its smaller and compact size fits into many , but sometimes when at home or etc, a 100% keyboard is better for multi control and larger keyboard helps during many tasks.

	So how about combining them into a modular keyboard, a 100% keyboard that can be dissassembled to be lesser keyboard, and then reassembled at moments notice. So the main parts are:
	1. 60% keyboard (numbers, letters, symbol, function keys {shift, endter, tab, backspace}, esc {esc key must be replaced with ~ when changing form to 75%}
	2. 65% keyboard (added insert, home, delete, ebd, page up, page down button next to backspace key + prt screen scroll lock, pause break button on top)
	3. 75% keyboard (added function keys, esc button move to up)
	4. 87% keyboard (added arrow keys)
	5. 100% keyboard (added numpad)
	6. 103% keyboard (added knob)
	7. 110% keyboard (added display)
	8. 120% keyboard (added slider)
